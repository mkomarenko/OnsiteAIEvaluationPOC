    "reference": "Product-led growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy that relies on using the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, expansion, conversion, and retention. In a PLG model, the product is designed to be self-service and easy to use, allowing users to experience its value without needing extensive sales or marketing efforts. This approach often involves offering free trials, freemium models, or low-cost entry points to attract users and encourage them to adopt the product. At Insight Partners, we define PLG as a mindset and operational model where the product plays an active role across the customer journey. This approach is particularly powerful for software companies looking to scale efficiently by reducing customer acquisition costs and increasing user engagement. Core Principles of PLG. 1. Lead with Product Value: Users experience the products value before they buy, making conversion more intuitive and organic. 2. Customer-Centric Design: The product is optimized for ease of use, fast onboarding, and long-term engagement. 3. Data-Driven Decisions: Companies leverage user behavior and product usage data to inform marketing, sales, and product development. 4. Scalable Growth Motion: The product becomes a growth engine, enabling viral adoption, self-service sales, and efficient upsell. The PLG Flywheel. PLG is best represented as a flywheel  a self-reinforcing cycle of growth  broken into three stages: 1. Find & Discover: Customers find and engage with the product through low-touch acquisition channels (e.g., freemium, community, SEO). 2. Try & Buy: Users quickly reach their aha moment through self-service onboarding and are encouraged to convert via value-based pricing. 3. Use & Expand: The product enables users to deepen their usage, expand across teams, and increase spend over time through upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Common PLG Tools - Freemium Plans (e.g., Linktree) - Free Trials (e.g., commercetools) - Self-Service Selling (e.g., Chargebee) - In-product Upsell and Feature Discovery (e.g., MURAL) - Referral Programs & Community Engagement (e.g., Postman). Why PLG Matters. PLG companies often demonstrate: - Higher net dollar retention (e.g., 123% median NDR) - Lower CAC due to self-service sales - Stronger product engagement and customer satisfaction - Scalable and repeatable growth loops. Weve seen these dynamics play out across many of our portfolio companies. Implemented thoughtfully, PLG can be a transformative growth engine for ScaleUps across verticals and buyer types  from SMB to enterprise.
